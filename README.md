## What it does

Hover the notch for a glance at your day. Click it to open everything else.

### 📚 Study
- **Boards countdown.** COMLEX, USMLE, shelf and block exams with presets, a dedicated period and days off. Count in days, weeks or study days (hours and minutes on exam day), with urgency colors and a calm mode. Your question bank's daily pace ("41 questions today"), practice exams with a score trend, milestone drop-downs, an exam-day checklist, good luck on exam morning, and a countdown card to share. Pin it to the closed notch.
- **Exam week mode.** One switch for a quieter notch and your Focus mode, plus a bedtime nudge the two nights before an exam.
- **Score tracker.** Block and shelf exam scores through the year, with the trend.
- **Reading tracker sync.** Connect a Google Sheets reading tracker (PBL, block or course readings) and check off chapters from the notch. It shows percent done, days to the exam, and **exactly how many pages to read today**, with a notch alert when you hit the goal.
- **Anki.** Cards due, reviews done today and your streak. Start a deck's review from the notch (uses AnkiConnect).
- **Focus timer and study sessions.** A Pomodoro timer that runs in the notch, with an optional Anki review goal, plus optional water-and-stretch reminders.
- **Anki card of the day,** flipped with a click.
- **Quick lookup** in AMBOSS, PubMed or UpToDate.
- **Weekly recap:** focus hours, study time, pages, questions and Anki reviews, as a card to share.
- **Screen time and a distraction guard.** See today's time studying, with AI and on distractions. During a focus timer, opening YouTube, Instagram or a game gets a gentle nudge.

### 📖 Bhagavad Gita
- **Daily reflection** on Home, including Exam week mode, with a compact verse-reference shortcut in the hover preview.
- Eight offline English paraphrases rotate at local midnight, with chapter-and-verse references. Each is clearly labeled as a paraphrase, rather than a verbatim translation.
- Browse the next reflection, return to today's selection, or copy the text with its reference.
- Open the linked verse for the Sanskrit, translation and context. Only opening that link needs a network connection; reflections need no account or location access.
- Turn the feature on or off in Settings › Bhagavad Gita.

### 🎵 Music
- Now Playing for Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube and anything else playing, with a live audio visualizer in the notch.
- Spotify extras (optional): like, add to a playlist, see when a song came from Smart Shuffle, and edit your Up Next queue.

### 🤖 AI and agents
- **Agents, answered from the notch:** Claude's multiple-choice questions and plan approvals become cards you answer in the notch. A check drops down when Claude, Codex or ChatGPT finishes.
- **Ask AI:** Claude, ChatGPT and Gemini inside the notch (<kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>⇧</kbd><kbd>Space</kbd>), signed in with your own accounts. Switch between them instantly, get a check when an answer is ready, and turn off any you don't use.
- **Claude usage meter:** your 5-hour and weekly limits at a glance.
- **Agents:** see your Claude Code and Codex sessions by name, including Codex in the ChatGPT app, and approve or deny Claude Code permission requests from the notch. While an agent works, the stethoscope turns into a live ECG.

### 🧰 Everyday
- **Drag a file to the notch** to AirDrop it, keep it on the Shelf, or upload it to Google Drive. Shelf files convert in one click: HEIC to JPG, a smaller PDF, or a smaller video, PDFs on the Shelf merge into one, photos become a single PDF, text copies straight out of an image, and papers go to Zotero in one click.
- **Clean screen mode** for recording and presenting: hides desktop icons and keeps calendar titles, agent names, music and clipboard out of the notch.
- **Teleprompter** right under the camera, so you read your script while looking at the lens. It pauses on hover and stays out of screen shares and recordings.
- **Screenshot drops:** new screenshots land on your Shelf, ready to drag anywhere.
- **Clipboard history** with pins.
- **Camera:** a quick mirror with photos, self-timer, zoom, grid, ring light and macOS video effects.
- **Status in the notch:** volume, brightness, battery and AirPods battery displays; download and video-export progress; meeting countdowns with a Join button; one-click eject for external drives.
- **Calendars:** Google, Outlook and school calendars (through macOS accounts or a private iCal link), with a reminder before each class: "Cardio lecture in 10 min · Room 1".
- **Utilities that replace other apps:** keep awake (automatically while agents work), quit apps when their last window closes, Rectangle-style window snapping, quick notes, and mic and camera-in-use dots.
- **Put the island anywhere:** under the notch, top left, top right or bottom center. Choose and order the tabs you want in the header. It hides while something is full screen and while apps you pick (like DaVinci Resolve) are in front.
- **Weather** and Outlook unread count.

Everything is optional and can be turned off in Settings.

## Install

**Requirements:** a Mac with Apple silicon (M1 or newer) and macOS 14.2 or later. A notch is best, but it also works below the menu bar on other displays. Download it on your Mac, not your phone.

### Download

1. Download `Attending-x.y.z.dmg` from [the latest release](../../releases/latest) (under **Assets**) and open it.
2. Drag **Attending** onto the **Applications** folder beside it.

### Open it the first time

Attending isn't notarized by Apple yet, so macOS blocks it the first time with a message that it can't verify the developer. To allow it (you only do this once):

1. Open Attending from Applications, then click **Done** or **Cancel** on the warning. Don't click Move to Trash.
2. Open the Apple menu () and select **System Settings** (or **System Preferences**).
3. Click **Privacy & Security** in the sidebar.
4. Scroll down to the **Security** section.
5. Find the message saying Attending was blocked, then click **Open Anyway**.
6. Enter your Mac password or use Touch ID to confirm, then click **Open**.

Attending then welcomes you and walks through the permissions it uses, one button each. If **Open Anyway** isn't there, open Attending again and go straight back to Privacy & Security: the button only shows for a while after a blocked launch. If you opened it from Downloads instead, Attending offers to move itself to Applications, where it can update itself.

**Still stuck?** [Report an install problem](../../issues/new?template=install-problem.yml) with your macOS version and a screenshot. Once it's running, **Settings › Help › Report a problem** fills in your versions and permissions for you.

**Updates are automatic.** Attending checks for new releases about once a day and tells you in the notch. Click **Update**, and it downloads, verifies and installs the new version, then relaunches. You can also check in Settings › Updates.

### Build from source

You need Xcode, or just the Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/med-abdullah/attending.git
cd attending
./scripts/create-signing-identity.sh   # optional: keeps macOS permissions across updates
./scripts/build-app.sh release
./scripts/install-app.sh               # copies to /Applications
open /Applications/Attending.app
```

To use your own bundle ID or signing identity, copy `scripts/local.env.example` to `scripts/local.env` and edit it.

## Setup (all optional)

| Feature | What to do |
|---|---|
| Calendar and weather | Allow Calendar for events; Location is only needed for optional weather. |
| Bhagavad Gita | Available offline; no permission or setup needed. |
| Volume and brightness in the notch | Settings › Volume & brightness › Grant access (Accessibility). |
| Reading tracker | Study › Trackers. Follow the steps to deploy a small Google Apps Script in your own account. Attending never sees your Google password. |
| Anki | Install the [AnkiConnect](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159) add-on. |
| Spotify extras | Settings › Media. Create a free app at [developer.spotify.com](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) with the redirect URI `http://127.0.0.1:43821/callback`, then paste its Client ID. |
| Claude Code agents | Click **Connect** in the setup window or Settings › Agents. It adds Attending's hooks and usage status line to `~/.claude/settings.json`, keeps everything else and saves a backup. (From the repo, `scripts/install-claude-hooks.py` does the same.) |
| Codex and ChatGPT agents | Nothing to set up. Sessions appear automatically. |
| Claude usage meter | Sign in to Claude in the Ask AI tab. |
| Google or Outlook calendars | Settings › Calendars › Add account (or paste a private iCal link). |
| Quit apps, window snapping, Zoom mute | Allow Attending in System Settings › Privacy & Security › Accessibility. |

## Privacy

Attending runs entirely on your Mac. There are no accounts, no analytics and no servers.
- **Calendar, location, camera and clipboard** stay on the device. The clipboard is kept in memory only.
- **Tokens and secrets** (Spotify, the Sheets bridge, private calendar links) are stored in files only your user can read. Notes stay in a local text file.
- **Screen time** keeps only daily totals per category (studying, AI, distractions). Window titles are read in the moment to sort them and never stored.
- **Agent monitoring** records session names and status, never transcripts or tool contents.

## Development

```sh
./scripts/build-app.sh      # debug build into build/Attending.app
./scripts/test.sh           # core checks, bridge and transport tests
```

The project is plain Swift Package Manager: SwiftUI inside an AppKit panel. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Support

Attending is free. If it helps you get through med school, you can
[buy me a coffee ☕](https://buymeacoffee.com/med.abdullah). It keeps new features coming
and pays for Apple notarization, so installs stop showing a warning.
